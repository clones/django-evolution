version 0.6.1 (25-October-2010):
	* Fixed compatibility problems with both Django 1.1 and Python 2.4.


version 0.6.0 (24-October-2010):
    * Added support for Django 1.2's ability to use multiple databases.

      This should use the existing routers used in your project. By default,
      operations will happen on the 'default' database. This can be overridden
      during evolution by passing --database=dbname to the evolve command.

      Patch by Marc Bee and myself.


version 0.5.1 (13-October-2010):
    * Made the evolve management command raise CommandError instead of
      sys.exit on failure. This makes it callable from third party software.
      Patch by Mike Conley.

    * Made the evolve functionality available through an evolve() function
      in the management command, allowing the rest of the command-specific
      logic to be skipped (such as console output and prompting). Patch
      by Mike Conley.

    * Fixed incorrect defaults on SQLite when adding null fields. (Bug #49)

      On SQLite, adding a null field without a default value would cause the
      field name to be the default. This was due to attempting to select the
      field name from the temporary table, but since the table didn't exist,
      the field name itself was being used as the value.

      We are now more explicit about the fields being selected and populated.
      We have two lists, and no longer assume both are identical. We also use
      NULL columns for temporary table fields unconditionally.

      Patch by myself and Chris Beaven.


version 0.5.0 (18-May-2010):
    * Initial public release
