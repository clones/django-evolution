Django Evolution
================

An implementation of schema evolution for the Django web framework.

For details on how to use Django Evolution, read the tutorial/instructions
contained in docs/evolution.txt.

Django Evolution is a work in progress; the interfaces are not guaranteed 
to be stable, and the SQL that is generated may sometimes be in error. 

In short, don't deploy this on a production site. If you do, and it breaks,
you get to keep every single one of the shiny little pieces. :-)
